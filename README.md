# Lexical Normalization

To get access to the results that our scripts generate, we have made a structure that allows you to run only two lines of code:

Once you are inside `code/scripts` folder on the command line, you can execute the following commands:

```
$ `python baselines-with-extensions.py`
```
```
$ `python score.py`
```


The first command will generate the prediction text files that will be stored in the output folder. These files will then be accessed by `score.py` which will evaluate the predictions and display results on the command line itself.

Since our code contains an implementation of a code base from the `Adapting Sequence to Sequence models for Text Normalization in Social Media` research paper, we use the pretrained model. To be able to run those models and generate files from the start refer to the `PRETRAINED.md` file.
